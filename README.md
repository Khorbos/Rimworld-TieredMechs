# Tiered Mechs - Rimworld mod

**A mod that adds new mechs with higher skill levels and speeds! These mechs do not replace the original ones. They are instead an upgrade you can research.**

----------

## Current mechs:
- LifterPlus
- ConstructoidPlus
- FabricorPlus
- AgrihandPlus
- CleansweeperPlus

**LifterPlus**

Increased speed.
Increased hauling capacity.

**ConstructoidPlus**

Increased speed.
Increased hauling capacity.
Increased skill level (Level 20)

**FabricorPlus**

Increased speed.
Increased hauling capacity.
Increased skill level (Level 20)
No food poison from meals made by it.

**AgrihandPlus**
Increased speed.
Increased skill level (Level 20)

**CleansweeperPlus**
Increased speed.
Increased cleaning speed (150%)

----------

## These values may change in the future.
Current plans may involve lowering the "plus" bots down and introducing an "ultra" teir that is level 20 with very high values and more crafting needs.

## More mechs
I also plan to add some upgraded combat bots. Things like an improved militor and whatnot. No plans to change the "Heavy" mechs at the moment.

**You will find these in the mech gestator once you research _high mechtech_.**
